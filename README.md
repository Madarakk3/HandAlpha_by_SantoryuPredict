## 🚀 Features

- **Real-time inference** in a notebook: capture webcam frames and predict letter gestures live.  
- **Trainable pipeline**: data loading, augmentation, model definition and training all in one `.ipynb`.  
- **Modular code organization**: clear sections for preprocessing, model, evaluation, and demo.  
- **Lightweight dependencies**: powered by TensorFlow / Keras and OpenCV.
